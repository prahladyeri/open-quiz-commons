        "Ensuring the Virtual DOM matches the real DOM exactly"
      ],
      "a": 1,
      "e": "RTL encourages testing the 'output' (what the user sees) rather than the 'implementation details' (state/props), making tests more resilient to refactoring."

        "getByRole",

      "a": 2,
      "e": "`getByRole` ensures that your UI is accessible to screen readers and reflects how assistive technology perceives the page structure."

      "q": "What is the difference between the `get...`, `query...`, and `find...` prefixes in RTL?",
      "o": [
        "There is no difference; they are aliases",
        "get throws an error if not found; query returns null; find returns a promise",
        "find is for CSS selectors; get is for text",
        "query is the only one that can interact with the keyboard"
      ],
      "a": 1,
      "e": "`getBy` is for immediate presence; `queryBy` is useful for asserting an element is NOT in the DOM; `findBy` is used for asynchronous elements (e.g., after an API call)."

      "a": 1,
      "e": "While `fireEvent` works, `user-event` is preferred because it better simulates full browser interactions like `keydown` and `keyup` events."

      "o": [
        "To take a screenshot of the test failure",

        "Compiles the React code into a production build",

        "Uploads the component to a testing server"
      ],
      "a": 1,
      "e": "The `render` function from RTL takes a React component and renders it into a container (usually `document.body`) so it can be queried."

      "q": "What is a 'Snapshot Test'?",
      "o": [
        "A test that records the performance speed of a component",
        "A test that compares the rendered output of a component to a previously saved 'golden' file",
        "A photo taken of the developer when a test fails",
        "A test that only runs on mobile screen sizes"
      ],
      "a": 1,
      "e": "Snapshot tests are used to catch unexpected UI changes by asserting that the current HTML structure hasn't drifted from the stored version."

    {
      "q": "How should you handle asynchronous updates, like an element appearing after a successful API fetch?",
      "o": [
        "Use a `setTimeout` inside the test",
        "Wrap the assertion in a `waitFor` block",
        "Call `render` again",
        "Use `getBy` and hope for the best"
      ],
      "a": 1,
      "e": "`waitFor` allows you to wait for a specific expectation to pass, retrying the check until the timeout is reached."

      "q": "In the context of Vitest or Jest, what is a 'Spy'?",
      "o": [
        "A tool that hides the test results from other developers",
        "A function that tracks calls, arguments, and return values of an existing function",
        "A hidden element in the DOM used for tracking",
        "A bug that is difficult to find"
      ],
      "a": 1,
      "e": "`vi.spyOn` or `jest.spyOn` allows you to observe how a function is used without necessarily replacing its original implementation."
    },
    {
      "q": "What is the purpose of `cleanup` in RTL?",
      "o": [
        "To delete all files in the test directory",
        "To unmount React trees that were mounted with `render` to prevent memory leaks",
        "To reset the CSS styles of the browser",
        "To clear the `localStorage` after every test"
      ],
      "a": 1,
      "e": "Most modern test runners handle this automatically, but `cleanup` ensures the DOM is fresh for the next test case."

      "a": 0,
      "e": "The `jest-dom` library provides custom matchers like `toBeDisabled()`, `toBeInTheDocument()`, and `toHaveTextContent()` for more readable assertions."

      "q": "What is 'mocking' an API in a test environment?",
      "o": [
        "Making fun of the backend team's code",
        "Using a library like MSW (Mock Service Worker) to intercept network requests and return fake data",
        "Running the actual backend server during the frontend tests",
        "Deleting the API endpoints from the production server"

      "a": 1,

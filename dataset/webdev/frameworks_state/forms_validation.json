      "o": [
        "Controlled components are faster; Uncontrolled are more secure",
        "Controlled components use React state for values; Uncontrolled use the DOM (refs)",
        "Controlled components only work with text inputs",
        "Uncontrolled components cannot be validated"
      ],
      "a": 1,
      "e": "In a controlled component, React is the 'single source of truth' for the input value via `useState`. In uncontrolled components, the form data is handled by the DOM itself."

      "o": [
        "To define the CSS background pattern",

        "To define a list of autocomplete options"
      ],
      "a": 1,
      "e": "The `pattern` attribute allows for complex validation (like phone numbers or zip codes) by matching the input against a regex string."

      "q": "When using React Hook Form, what does the 'register' function do?",
      "o": [
        "It signs the user up for a new account",

        "It resets the form to its initial values"
      ],
      "a": 1,
      "e": "The `register` method applies the necessary event listeners (onChange, onBlur) and refs to an input so the library can track its value and errors."

        "Axios",
        "Moment.js"

      "a": 1,
      "e": "Yup (and Zod) allows you to define a schema object that describes the shapes, types, and validation rules for your form data."

      "q": "Why is it important to perform validation on the Server even if you have Client-side validation?",
      "o": [
        "Client-side validation is too slow",
        "Client-side validation can be bypassed by disabling JavaScript or using tools like Postman",

        "It isn't important; one or the other is sufficient"
      ],
      "a": 1,
      "e": "Client-side validation is for User Experience (UX); Server-side validation is for Security and Data Integrity."

      "q": "What is the 'FormData' API used for in JavaScript?",
      "o": [
        "To style forms using JavaScript",

      "a": 1,

      ],
      "a": 1,
      "e": "Tracking 'touched' state allows developers to wait until a user has finished interacting with a field before showing them an error message, preventing annoying 'early' errors."
